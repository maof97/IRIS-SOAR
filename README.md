## Features

Although IRIS-SOAR is in its early development stages, it promises a range of innovative features in its final release, including:

- Receiving and forwarding alerts from various integration points, converting them seamlessly into IRIS alerts.
- Enhancing IRIS-Cases with rich context gathered from different sources through integrations, managed efficiently using playbooks on a case-by-case basis.
- Automating the escalation or merging of one or more IRIS-Alerts into an IRIS-Case, directed by alert-specific playbooks.
- Facilitating automated actions on IRIS-Cases using case-specific playbooks â€” whether it's closing a false positive or escalating a genuine incident to a higher severity level.
- Easy extensibility allowing for the straightforward addition of new integrations or playbooks with minimal effort.

### Available Integrations

Here are the integrations available at the moment:

- **Elastic SIEM**: Facilitates the transition of alerts from Elastic to IRIS while also enhancing cases with Elastic data.
- **IBM QRadar**: Imports offenses from QRadar to IRIS as alerts and enrich cases with QRadar data.
- **VirusTotal**: Provides indicator threat intelligence context for individual cases or alerts.
- **Matrix**: Keeps users updated about alerts, new cases, and fresh findings.

Feel free to explore and make the most of IRIS-SOAR's evolving capabilities!
