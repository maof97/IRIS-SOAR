Z-SOAR features
==============

Z-SOAR is currently still in early development. The following features are planned for the final release:

- Get detections from various sources (called 'integrations') and
  forward them to Znuny/OTRS

- Provide context for tickets by getting information from various
  sources ('integrations') and adding them to the ticket. All this can be controlled on case-to case basis using 'playbooks'.

- Using playbooks it is also possible to automate actions on tickets. For
  example, if a ticket is deemed to be a false positive, it can be closed automatically or if a ticket is deemed to be a real incident, it can be escalated to a higher level of support.

- Z-SOAR is designed and build to be easily extensible. It is possible to
  add new integrations or playbooks to Z-SOAR with minimal effort.
